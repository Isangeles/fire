.SH NAME
trade - client request for trade.
.SH DESCRIPTION
The trade request is used by the client to exchange items between one object controlled
by the client and another object.
.br
Trade request contains IDs and serial values of two objects(buyer and seller) and list
of items to exchange.
.br
Items to exchange are stored inside request as maps with item ID as key and
list with serial values as a value.
.br
Example JSON map to sell 5 items with ID 'coin' and 1 with 'ironSword':
.nf
"items": {
  "coin": [
    "0",
    "8",
    "4",
    "102",
    "10",
  ],
  "ironSword": [
    "14",
  ]
}
.br
This request needs to be confirmed by the owner of another object.
.br
To do this, the server saves this request and sends a trade response to the owner of another object.
.br
If the owner sends accept request with ID received in trade response,
the server will realize pending request.
.br
After the owner of another object sent an accept request, the server will send a trade-accepted
response to a client who sent a trade request.
